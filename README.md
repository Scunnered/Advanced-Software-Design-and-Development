# Advanced-JAVA-Software-Design-and-Development
RGU module - CM2100

1	Demonstrate an extended knowledge and understanding of object oriented modelling and design concepts concerning inheritance, interfaces and abstract classes.

2	Design appropriate and efficient implementations for commonly occurring data abstractions.

3	Identify and implement simple examples of selected software system classes.

4	Use an event handling model to identify components and interaction required to design and implement object oriented programs that incorporate a graphical user interface.

5	Analyse, and make a critical comparison between, alternative designs of algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, scalability and security concerns.

# Assessment Part 1 - Pratical Exam
Personal Diary Application - Backend Classes

The aim of this coding exercise is to implement functionality within a set of interacting
classes that will form the back-end of a GUI that you will create in the GUI application
coursework.

# Assessment Part 2 - Coursework Specification
Personal Diary Application â€“ GUI Application

The aim of this coursework had me create a Graphical User Interface that adds interactive
functionality to an existing Java project.

# Assesment Part 3 - Algorithm
Implementation and analysis of two sorting algorithms
The coursework was designed to test: 

- Ability to implement specified algorithms 

- Understanding of the concept of computational time and space complexity 

- Ability to accurately and concisely report on experimental findings and compare them to theory 

- Use of libraries to generate charts of data

# Assessment Part 4 - Coursework Specification
Courier - Using JCF classes

The tasks tested my ability to use different collection types from the Java Collections
Framework, and the methods from the Collections classe
