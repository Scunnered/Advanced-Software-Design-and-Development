RGU module - CM2100

1	Demonstrate an extended knowledge and understanding of object oriented modelling and design concepts concerning inheritance, interfaces and abstract classes.
2	Design appropriate and efficient implementations for commonly occurring data abstractions.
3	Identify and implement simple examples of selected software system classes.
4	Use an event handling model to identify components and interaction required to design and implement object oriented programs that incorporate a graphical user interface.
5	Analyse, and make a critical comparison between, alternative designs of algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, scalability and security concerns.
